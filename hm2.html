                    O'Brien was born in New York City, the son of Lisa (née Rhodes), a former actress who also ran an
                    acting
                    school,
                    and Patrick O'Brien, a camera operator. He grew up in Springfield Township, New Jersey, until the
                    age of
                    twelve, when he and his family moved to Hermosa Beach, California. His father is of Irish descent,
                    and
                    his mother is of Italian, English and Spanish ancestry. After graduating from Mira Costa High School
                    in
                    2009,
                    he considered pursuing sports broadcasting and possibly working for the New York Mets. At 14,
                    O'Brien
                    began
                    posting original videos onto his YouTube channel. With the videos developing, a local producer and
                    director
                    approached him about doing work for a web series while in his senior year of high school. While
                    working
                    on
                    the webseries, O'Brien met an actor who connected him with a manager. He had planned to attend
                    Syracuse
                    University as a sports broadcasting major, but decided to pursue an acting career instead.
